# NLP - Unsupervised Papers Clustering

---

When performing a literature review, researchers needs to read a lot of papers and select the important ones.
Also, for performing meta-analysis on papers, researchers read many papers to clustering then to read just the necessary ones.

Unsupervised paper clustering of papers can be used to help researchers to perform this reviews.

Database was generated by PubMed and WebOfKnowledge platforms.
XML and HTML formats were read and a joined pandas dataframe built.

By the manuscript abstracts, using tokenization, stemming and lemmatization, and TF-IDF, papers were clustered using dendrogram simple linkage.
